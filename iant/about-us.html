					<h2>History</h2>	
						<p>
					IANT was established in February 1971 and was incorporated in the state of Texas as a non-profit, tax exempt, and religious organization. Initially, the founding members held Masjid services at their respective homes. As the community in the Dallas area grew, a central Masjid was founded at Bagdad Road in Grand Prairie, TX. However, the location was of inconvenience to a large number of families residing in the Richardson/Garland area and thus, the IANT relocated to a home with a barn on Abrams Road in Richardson in 1979. On October 30, 1982, a grand ceremony ushered the development of the newfound Mosque and funding commenced. In 1983, the Restland Cemetery was secured for Muslim burial needs. In 1985, the city of Richardson granted a final occupancy permit and an Inauguration Ceremony was held. As the community grew larger, a surprise visitor stopped by the Masjid. The world-famous boxer Muhammad Ali joined for afternoon prayers and socialized with all who were present. 
					<br /><br />

					During the ensuing years, the community grew exponentially and forced the administration to embark an expansion project that included a larger prayer hall and enhanced facilities for Janaza, conferences and social activities. A medical clinic with certified doctors was also established. Dr. Yusuf Ziya Kavakci, a well known Turkish scholar who served as the Imam of the Masjid at that time, initiated the IQA Quranic Academy, with the hopes of cultivating scholars of the future. He also initiated the Suffa Islamic Seminary to allow students to learn and share their Islamic heritage and culture. To engage the youth of the community, the IANT Youth program was introduced in 2010, followed by the IANT sports program in 2012. These services, along with other projects and expansions, have made IANT one of the largest Muslim communities in the state of Texas.

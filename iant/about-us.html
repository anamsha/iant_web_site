				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<img src="images/about-us-header.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
				<p>The Islamic Association of North Texas (IANT) is a registered tax-deductible non-profit 501(c)(3)
					organization of Muslims dedicated to
					worship, education, and community service in the Richardson (North Texas) area. Our Tax ID is
					23-7181345.
					<br /><br />
					IANT was established in February 1971 and was incorporated in the state of Texas as a non-profit,
					tax exempt, and religious organization. The initial founding group consisted of six Muslim families
					and some students, which rotated between each other's homes as Masjids. As the Muslim community in
					the Dallas area grew, it was decided to purchase three frame houses on Bagdad Road in Grand Prairie,
					Texas, which became the headquarters of IANT. However, the region proved inadequate because most
					newly arriving families preferred the Richardson/Garland area which was in a closer proximity to the
					city of Dallas and provided better school districts; thus the need for larger premises became a
					necessity.
					<br /><br />
					In 1979, IANT purchased a large frame house with a barn on Abrams Road in Richardson. On October 30,
					1982, a big ceremony took place and the fundraising for the new Mosque began. In 1983, the Restland
					Cemetery, which is in close proximity to IANT, was secured for Muslim burial needs. Eventually, in
					1985, the city of Richardson granted a final occupancy permit. During that month an Inauguration
					Ceremony was held.
					<br /><br />

					As the community grew larger, a surprise visitor stopped by the Masjid. The world-famous boxer
					Muhammad Ali joined for afternoon prayers and the socialized with everyone present. During the
					ensuing years, the community grew exponentially and forced the administration to embark a big
					expansion project with a larger prayer hall, better facilities for the ladies, a body preparation
					facility (which is used for funerals), a multi-purpose hall for conferences and other social
					activities such as exhibitions and games. A medical clinic with certified doctors was also
					established.
					<br /><br />

					During this period of change, the community around the association grew so large, that Dr. Yusuf
					Ziya Kavakci, a well known Turkish scholar who served as the Imam of the Masjid at that time,
					initiated the IQA Quranic Academy, with the goal of generating scholars of the future to serve the
					entire nation. Another project by Dr. Kavakci was the Suffa Islamic Seminary, where students could
					learn and share their Islamic heritage and culture.
					<br /><br />

					To pursue the youth of the community, the IANT Youth program was introduced in 2010, followed
					by the IANT sports program in 2012. These services, along with other projects and expansions, have made IANT one of
					the largest Muslim communities in the state of Texas.
					<br /><br />

					IANT encourages brothers and sisters of all faiths to come visit our masjid (mosque), facilities,
					and take part in
					tours and other outreach activities.
